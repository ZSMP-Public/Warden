# ⚙️ Setup 
## 🌍 Preparing the Environment
In order to use any component of Warden, you'll need to properly set up your environment. How you wish to structure your environment is completely up to you.

### 🏠 Single Location
By default, both the database and the bot rely on the same Environmental Variable source file (`.env`), which is perfect if both components will be hosted on the same machine.

If you intend to use the bot and database on one machine, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the details accordingly. Skip the following section.

### 🌐 Separate Machines
If you intend to host them separately, you'll need to copy the `.env` file to both locations:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example Bot/.env
   cp .env.example Database/.env
   ```
   Modify the `docker-compose.yml` to remove the following lines. This will instead use the `.env` file in the root directory rather than the parent.
   ```yml
    env_file:
     - ../.env
   ```
   Likewise, for both files `seyfert.config.js` and `index.ts`, replace the lines:
   ```js
   require('dotenv').config({ path: '../.env' });
   ```
   with:
   ```js
   require('dotenv').config();
   ```
---

_🔐 Regardless, make sure you change your details here afterward and ensure both files match._

### 🤖 Bot
1. You will need to create an application for the Bot instance on the Discord [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and populate the `TOKEN` in your **env** file with your generated token. 

2. Install all necessary components:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 🗄️ Database
The PostgreSQL Database serves as both the storage and middleman between the MC Server & Discord Bot, facilitating the connection without requiring an additional Server Port.

This implementation is only as secure as you make it; you'll need to change the Database username and password.

1. You can start the container, and it will automatically create the schema:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. To verify it worked, you can connect to the database:
    ```bash
    # Connect to the container
    docker-compose exec db psql -U yourusername -d mclink
    
    # Once connected, list the tables
    \dt
    
    # View the schema of a specific table
    \d linking_requests
    \d linked_accounts 
    ```

If for some reason you find yourself needing to reset everything and start fresh:
```bash
# Stop and remove containers, networks, volumes, and images
docker-compose down -v

# Then start again
docker-compose up -d
```
